Deploying Application Code: Workflow Simulation

    Use Version Control:
        Set up a Git repository for your application code.
        Ensure that the code is versioned and regularly committed.

    Run the Code Locally:
        Use a local development environment (e.g., Docker) to run your application.
        Test the functionality and catch any issues before pushing changes.

    Make Code Changes:
        Implement new features or address bugs in your code.
        Ensure that changes are well-documented and easy to understand.

    Submit Changes for Review:
        Create a pull request (PR) in your version control system (e.g., GitHub).
        Include a description of the changes made and request reviews from your team.

    Run Automated Tests:
        Integrate automated tests using tools like Terraform's terratest or other testing frameworks.
        Ensure that tests run successfully before merging changes.

    Merge and Release:
        Once the PR is approved, merge the changes into the main branch.
        Tag the release in your version control system to keep track of versions.

    Deploy:
        Use Terraform Cloud to deploy your application code.
        Ensure that you have secured sensitive variables (e.g., API keys) using Terraform Cloudâ€™s secure variable feature.
        If applicable, explore Terraform Cloud's private registry to store and share your modules.
